📽 [Recording of the meeting](https://youtu.be/c0w4tEaQk3Q)

The main topic of this meeting was the ESP32, starting with a presentation of the famous ESP32 Youtuber Andrea Spiess. Next several presentation of FORTH2020 members show how they leverage the ESP32 platform in FORTH with ESP32Forth for their DIY projects. Then Brad Nelson gaves some updates on the latest ESP32Forth development. After that, we have a presentation of Fignition single board educational computer, and another about programming the Gameboy Advance in FORTH. We wrap up the meeting with Dr Ting's latest updates on his JavaForthMachine.
